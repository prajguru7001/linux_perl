a. To copy the player.txt file from the current directory to your home directory, you can use the cp command:

bash
Copy code
cp player.txt ~/
This command will copy the file player.txt to your home directory (~).

b. To display the first three records from the player.txt file, you can use the head command with the -n option:

bash
Copy code
head -n 3 player.txt
This command will display the first three records from the file.

c. To display the names of players who scored above 5000 runs and store them in a run.txt file, you can use the awk command:

bash
Copy code
awk -F ', ' '$4 > 5000 {print $1}' player.txt > run.txt
This command will search for records where the fourth field (runs) is greater than 5000, extract the first field (player's name), and store them in the run.txt file.

d. To sort the players according to their debut date (month), you can use the sort command with the -k option:

bash
Copy code
sort -t '-' -k 3M player.txt
This command will sort the records based on the third field (debut date) in a month format, considering the hyphen (-) as the field separator.

e. To display the records of players whose name contains "Sharma" or "Varma" using a single command, you can use the grep command with the -i (ignore case) and -E (extended regex) options:

bash
Copy code
grep -i -E 'Sharma|Varma' player.txt
This command will search for records that contain "Sharma" or "Varma" in the player's name, ignoring the case.

f. To display the player details whose debut month is October, you can use the grep command with the -i (ignore case) and -w (match whole word) options:

bash
Copy code
grep -i -w 'oct' player.txt
This command will search for records where the debut month is "Oct," ignoring the case.

g. To display the total runs scored by all players, you can use the awk command to sum the runs from the fourth field:

bash
Copy code
awk -F ', ' '{sum+=$4} END {print sum}' player.txt
This command will calculate the sum of the fourth field (runs) and display the total.

h. To display the records of Ajay and Sourabh (searching names in a case-insensitive manner), you can use the grep command with the -i (ignore case) option:

bash
Copy code
grep -i 'Ajay\|Sourabh' player.txt
This command will search for records that contain "Ajay" or "Sourabh" in the player's name, ignoring the case.

i. To display the player's names whose debut year is 1991, you can use the awk command to extract the debut year and compare it with "1991":

bash
Copy code
awk -F ', ' '$3 ~ /1991/ {print $1}' player.txt
This command will search for records where the third field (debut year) matches "1991" and print the first field (player's name).

j. To display only the names of players whose names start with "A" or "S," you can use the awk command with a conditional statement:

bash
Copy code
awk -F ', ' '$1 ~ /^A|^
